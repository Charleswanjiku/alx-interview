The function uses a set called unlocked to keep track of the boxes that have been unlocked so far, and a stack called stack to keep track of the boxes that still need to be checked.
The function starts by adding the first box (box 0) to the unlocked set and the stack. It then enters a loop where it pops a box from the stack, checks all the keys in that box, and adds any new boxes that can be unlocked to the unlocked set and the stack.
The loop continues until the stack is empty. Finally, the function returns True if all boxes have been unlocked (i.e. the size of the unlocked set is equal to n) or False otherwise.
